 This is CiRiX 2, a game created by Adok (Claus Volko). This time it is for a
 solo player. The number of the block shows how many blocks have to be
 adjacent to each other for them to be cleared. This number is also the score
 you will get for clearing these blocks. As soon as you reach the top of the
 screen, the game is over.

 Greetings fly to my friends!
